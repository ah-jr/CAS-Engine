# CAS-Engine

Use this in your application to easily play and arrange audio files using DirectSound or ASIO drivers.
You can dinamically link to the library by compiling the CasEngine.dproj and using the generated DLL.
To learn how to use it, see examples/playAudio.cpp.

IMPORTANT: For the time, you'll have do download ffmpeg binaries seperately. I use [gyan's essentials build](https://www.gyan.dev/ffmpeg/builds) and it works very well. Put the executable in a folder named ffmpeg. You can see how it works using our [CAS-AudioEditor](https://github.com/airtonhjr/CAS-Audio-Player) app.
