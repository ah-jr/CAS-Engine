# CAS-Engine

Use this in your application to easily play and arrange audio files using ASIO drivers.

IMPORTANT: This project is still in early development. For the time, you'll have do download ffmpeg binaries and OpenAsio.dll seperately, and put it in the same folder as your application. You can see how it works using our [CAS-AudioEditor](https://github.com/airtonhjr/CAS-Audio-Player) app.
